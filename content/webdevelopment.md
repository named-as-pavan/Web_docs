## Getting Started

Before diving into the specifics of web development, it's important to set up your development environment. Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Install a Code Editor**: Popular choices include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).
2. **Set Up Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most widely used version control system. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) to manage your projects.
3. **Learn Basic Command Line**: Familiarize yourself with basic command line operations to navigate your file system and manage your projects.

## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It structures the content on the web. Here are some key concepts:

- **Elements and Tags**: HTML uses elements and tags to define the structure of a webpage.
- **Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
- **Common Tags**: `<div>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc.
